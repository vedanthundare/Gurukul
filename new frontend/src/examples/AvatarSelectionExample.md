## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your project root and add your AI provider API keys:

```env
# AI Provider API Keys
VITE_MESHY_API_KEY=your_meshy_api_key_here
VITE_TRIPO_API_KEY=your_tripo_api_key_here
VITE_STABILITY_API_KEY=your_stability_api_key_here
```

### 2. API Key Configuration
You can obtain API keys from:
- **Meshy AI**: https://meshy.ai - Sign up for free tier (200 credits/month)
- **Tripo AI**: https://tripo3d.ai - Free tier available (100 generations/month)
- **Stability AI**: https://stability.ai - Pay-per-use model

### 3. Component Usage
The enhanced AvatarSelection component is already integrated into your application. Simply navigate to the Avatar Selection page to use it.

## Usage Examples

### Text-to-3D Generation
1. Navigate to the "AI-Generated 3D Models" tab
2. Enter a descriptive prompt in the text area:
   ```
   Examples:
   - "a futuristic robot with glowing blue eyes"
   - "a medieval knight in shining armor"
   - "a cute cartoon cat with big eyes"
   - "a cyberpunk hacker with neon accessories"
   ```
3. Select quality and style settings
4. Click "Generate 3D Model"
5. Wait for generation to complete (30 seconds to 10 minutes depending on quality)
6. Preview the model in the 3D viewer
7. Select as avatar or download the model

### Image-to-3D Generation
1. Navigate to the "AI-Generated 3D Models" tab
2. Switch to the "Image to 3D" tab within the AI generator
3. Upload an image file (PNG, JPG, WebP, BMP - max 10MB)
4. Configure generation settings
5. Click "Generate 3D Model"
6. Preview and use the generated model

### Quality Settings
- **Low (Fast)**: 30-60 seconds, < 1K triangles
- **Medium (Balanced)**: 1-3 minutes, 1K-5K triangles
- **High (Detailed)**: 3-10 minutes, 5K-20K triangles

### Style Options
- **Realistic**: Photorealistic appearance with detailed textures
- **Cartoon**: Stylized, colorful, and playful appearance
- **Stylized**: Artistic interpretation with unique visual style
- **Low Poly**: Minimalist geometric style with flat surfaces

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Not Working**
   - Verify the API key is correctly set in the `.env` file
   - Check if the API key has sufficient credits/quota
   - Ensure the key is for the correct provider

2. **Generation Fails**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify the prompt meets the requirements (3-500 characters)
   - Try a different quality setting or provider

3. **3D Model Not Loading**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Ensure WebGL is supported in your browser
   - Try refreshing the page

4. **File Upload Issues**
   - Verify file format is supported (PNG, JPG, WebP, BMP)
   - Check file size is under 10MB
   - Ensure image dimensions are at least 256x256 pixels

### Performance Tips
- Use "Low" quality for quick testing
- Use "Medium" quality for most use cases
- Reserve "High" quality for final production models
- Clear browser cache if experiencing issues
- Use GLB format for best performance

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Real-time generation preview
- Model editing and customization tools
- Batch generation capabilities
