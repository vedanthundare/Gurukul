Lilavati by Bhaskara II - Ancient Indian Mathematical Text

Introduction
The Lilavati is a remarkable 12th-century mathematical treatise written by the Indian mathematician Bhaskara II (1114-1185 CE). Named after his daughter, this text covers various branches of mathematics including arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and mensuration.

Arithmetic (Patiganita)
Eight operations of arithmetic are described:
1. Addition (संकलन, Sankalana)
2. Subtraction (व्यवकलन, Vyavakalana)
3. Multiplication (गुणन, Gunana)
4. Division (भागहार, Bhagahara)
5. Square (वर्ग, Varga)
6. Square root (वर्गमूल, Vargamula)
7. Cube (घन, Ghana)
8. Cube root (घनमूल, Ghanamula)

Number System
The Lilavati employs the decimal place-value system using nine digits (1-9) and zero. Bhaskara explains:
"Just as in the place of ones, ten is represented in the tens place, and hundred in the hundreds place, similarly other numbers are represented according to their place values."

Fractions and Operations
Bhaskara provides rules for operations with fractions:
"To add fractions, make the denominators the same, then add the numerators. To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together."

For example, to add 1/3 and 1/4:
1/3 + 1/4 = (4+3)/12 = 7/12

Algebra (Bijaganita)
Bhaskara introduces the concept of an unknown quantity, which he calls "yavattavat" (as much as). He solves linear and quadratic equations and provides methods for solving systems of equations.

For solving quadratic equations of the form ax² + bx + c = 0, Bhaskara gives the formula:
x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac))/2a

Geometry and Mensuration
The Lilavati contains formulas for calculating areas and volumes of various geometric shapes:

Circle:
Area = πr²
Circumference = 2πr
where π is approximated as 3.1416

Triangle:
Area = (1/2) × base × height
Area = √(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)) where s = (a+b+c)/2 (semi-perimeter)

Sphere:
Volume = (4/3)πr³
Surface area = 4πr²

Mathematical Problems and Their Applications
The Lilavati presents mathematics through engaging word problems. For example:

"O beautiful maiden with beaming eyes, tell me, if you understand the method of inversion, what number multiplied by 3, then increased by three-quarters of the product, then divided by 7, then diminished by one-third of the quotient, then multiplied by itself, then diminished by 52, the square root of the remainder extracted, then increased by 8, then divided by 10, gives the final result 2?"

Sound and Mathematics
Bhaskara discusses the relationship between sound, music, and mathematics. He explains how mathematical ratios determine musical intervals and how the length of a string affects its pitch.

The text describes how different musical notes correspond to specific mathematical ratios:
- Shadja (Sa): 1:1
- Rishabha (Re): 9:8
- Gandhara (Ga): 5:4
- Madhyama (Ma): 4:3
- Panchama (Pa): 3:2
- Dhaivata (Dha): 5:3
- Nishada (Ni): 15:8

Bhaskara explains that when a string is divided according to these ratios, it produces the corresponding notes. This mathematical understanding of sound forms the basis of Indian classical music theory.
