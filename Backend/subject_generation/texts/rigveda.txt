Rigveda - Ancient Indian Sacred Text

Book 1, Hymn 1: To Agni
ॐ अग्निमीळे पुरोहितं यज्ञस्य देवम् ऋत्विजम् । होतारं रत्नधातमम् ॥
Om, I praise Agni, the priest of the sacrifice, the divine, the ritual performer, the invoker who bestows treasures.

अग्निः पूर्वेभिर्ऋषिभिरीड्यो नूतनैरुत । स देवानेह वक्षति ॥
Agni, worthy of praise by ancient seers and modern ones, may he bring the gods here.

अग्निना रयिमश्नवत् पोषमेव दिवेदिवे । यशसं वीरवत्तमम् ॥
Through Agni, may one obtain wealth, prosperity day by day, glorious and most full of heroic sons.

Book 1, Hymn 23: To Vayu and Indra
आ वायो भूष शुचिपा उप नः इमा सु मध्वा सजोषा । 
O Vayu, come to us, you who drink the clear Soma, with mutual delight, these sweet offerings.

इन्द्रवायू इमे सुता उप प्रयोभिरा गतम् । इन्दवो वामुशन्ति हि ॥
Indra and Vayu, these Soma juices have been prepared; come with your gifts, for the Soma drops desire you.

Book 10, Hymn 129: The Creation Hymn (Nasadiya Sukta)
नासदासीन्नो सदासीत्तदानीं नासीद्रजो नो व्योमा परो यत् ।
किमावरीवः कुह कस्य शर्मन्नम्भः किमासीद्गहनं गभीरम् ॥
Then there was neither existence nor non-existence. There was neither the realm of space nor the sky which is beyond. What stirred? Where? In whose protection? Was there water, bottomlessly deep?

न मृत्युरासीदमृतं न तर्हि न रात्र्या अह्न आसीत्प्रकेतः ।
आनीदवातं स्वधया तदेकं तस्माद्धान्यन्न परः किञ्चनास ॥
There was neither death nor immortality then. There was no distinguishing sign of night nor of day. That One breathed, windless, by its own impulse. Other than that there was nothing beyond.

Book on Sound and Vibration
The Vedic understanding of sound (shabda) is profound. Sound is considered not just a physical phenomenon but a spiritual one. The primordial sound OM (ॐ) is considered the source of all creation.

In Vedic tradition, mantras are sacred sound formulas that, when recited with proper pronunciation (ucchāraṇa), rhythm, and devotion, can create powerful vibrations that affect both the chanter and the environment.

The concept of Nada Brahma suggests that the entire universe is a manifestation of sound vibration. The universe itself was created through sound - the cosmic vibration of OM.

Different sounds are believed to affect different chakras or energy centers in the body. Proper chanting can balance these energy centers and promote physical and spiritual well-being.
