2.1 Austerity, self-study, and surrender to God constitute the yoga of action.

योगाङ्गानुष्ठानादशुद्धिक्षये ज्ञानदीप्तिराविवेकख्यातेः ॥२८॥
2.28 By the practice of the limbs of yoga, the impurities are destroyed and there arises the light of wisdom, leading to discriminative discernment.

यमनियमासनप्राणायामप्रत्याहारधारणाध्यानसमाधयोऽष्टावङ्गानि ॥२९॥

2.32 The observances are: cleanliness, contentment, austerity, self-study, and surrender to God.

Chapter 3: Vibhuti Pada (On Powers)

देशबन्धश्चित्तस्य धारणा ॥१॥
3.1 Concentration is binding the mind to a place.

तत्र प्रत्ययैकतानता ध्यानम् ॥२॥
3.2 Meditation is the uninterrupted flow of cognition toward that object.

तदेवार्थमात्रनिर्भासं स्वरूपशून्यमिव समाधिः ॥३॥
3.3 When only the object of meditation shines forth in the mind, as if devoid of the mind's own form, that is absorption.

त्रयमेकत्र संयमः ॥४॥
3.4 The three together—concentration, meditation, and absorption—constitute integration.

तज्जयात्प्रज्ञालोकः ॥५॥
3.5 By mastering integration comes the light of insight.

On Sound and Vibration in Yoga
In yoga philosophy, sound (shabda) is considered a powerful tool for meditation and spiritual growth. The practice of mantra repetition (japa) uses sacred sounds to focus the mind and create specific vibrations in the body.

The concept of "nada yoga" or the yoga of sound involves deep listening and meditation on internal sounds. As one progresses in this practice, subtler and subtler sounds can be perceived, eventually leading to the perception of the "unstruck sound" (anahata nada), which is said to be the primordial vibration of the universe.

The sacred syllable OM (ॐ) is considered particularly important in yoga practice. Patanjali mentions in sutra 1.27: "तस्य वाचकः प्रणवः" (tasya vācakaḥ praṇavaḥ) - "The word expressing Him is OM." The practice of chanting OM is said to lead the mind toward samadhi.

Different sounds are associated with different chakras or energy centers in the body. By chanting specific mantras, a practitioner can activate and balance these energy centers, promoting physical and spiritual well-being.
