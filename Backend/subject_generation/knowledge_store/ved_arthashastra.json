  "translation": "A modest mind is better than an inflated one.",
  "explanation": "Arthashastra, the ancient Indian wisdom of health and wellness, teaches us to cultivate a modest spirit. This philosophy emphasizes self-realization, the harmony between mind and body, and the importance of inner peace. It draws from Vedic teachings on self-knowledge and the role of the body in meditating oneself. The concept also highlights the historical significance of mental practices in promoting overall well-being, suggesting that true health is not just physical but also psychological. In today's modern context, this idea resonates with mindfulness and holistic wellness approaches, emphasizing individualized attention to personal growth and emotional balance.",
