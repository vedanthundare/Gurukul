  "translation": "May all be happy, may all be free from disease, may all see auspiciousness, may none suffer.",
  "explanation": "According to Wikipedia: The Vedas ( or ; Sanskrit: वेदः, romanized: Vēdaḥ, lit. 'knowledge'), sometimes collectively called the Veda, are a large body of religious texts originating in ancient India. Composed in Vedic Sanskrit, the texts constitute the oldest layer of Sanskrit literature and the oldest scriptures of Hinduism.\nThere are four Vedas: the Rigveda, the Yajurveda, the Samaveda and the Atharvaveda. Each Veda has four subdivisions – the Samhitas (mantras and benedictions), the Brahmanas (commentaries on and explanation of rituals, ceremonies and sacrifices – Yajñas), the Aranyakas (text on rituals, ceremonies, sacrifices and symbolic-sacrifices), and the Upanishads (texts discussing meditation, philosophy and spiritual knowledge). Some scholars add a fifth category – the Upāsanās (worship). The texts of the Upanishads discuss ideas akin to the heterodox sramana traditions. The Samhitas and Brahmanas describe daily rituals and are generally meant for the Brahmacharya and Gr̥hastha stages of the Chaturashrama system, while the Aranyakas and Upanishads are meant for the Vānaprastha and Sannyasa stages, respectively.\nVedas are śruti (\"what is heard\"), distinguishing them from other religious texts, which are called smr̥ti (\"what is remembered\"). Hindus consider the Vedas to be apauruṣeya, which means \"not of a man, superhuman\" and \"impersonal, authorless\", revelations of sacred sounds and texts heard by ancient sages after intense meditation.\nThe Vedas have been orally transmitted since the 2nd millennium BCE with the help of elaborate mnemonic techniques. The mantras, the oldest part of the Vedas, are recited in the modern age for their phonology rather than the semantics, and are considered to be \"primordial rhythms of creation\", preceding the forms to which they refer. By reciting them the cosmos is regenerated, \"by enlivening and nourishing the forms of creation at their base.\"\nThe various Indian philosophies and Hindu sects have taken differing positions on the Vedas. Schools of Indian philosophy that acknowledge the importance or primal authority of the Vedas comprise Hindu philosophy specifically and are together classified as the six \"orthodox\" (āstika) schools. However, śramaṇa traditions, such as Charvaka, Ajivika, Buddhism, and Jainism, which did not regard the Vedas as authoritative, are referred to as \"heterodox\" or \"non-orthodox\" (nāstika) schools.\n\n\n\nThis topic is significant in history because it represents an important aspect of ancient Indian knowledge systems. The study of vedas in the context of history provides valuable insights into how ancient wisdom can inform modern understanding.",
