  "translation": "May all be happy, may all be free from disease, may all see auspiciousness, may none suffer.",
  "explanation": "According to Wikipedia: There have been several claims for the 'longest sentence in the English language' revolving around the longest printed sentence.\nSentences can be made arbitrarily long in various ways. One method is successive iterations, such as \n\"Someone thinks that someone thinks that someone thinks that nobody thinks that...,\" while another method is combining shorter clauses. Sentences can also be extended by recursively embedding clauses one into another, such as\n\n\"The mouse ran away.\"\n\"The mouse that the cat hit ran away.\"\n...\nThis also highlights the difference between linguistic performance and linguistic competence, because the language can support more variation than can reasonably be created or recorded. As a result, one linguistics textbook concludes that, in theory, \"there is no longest English sentence.\"\n\nThis topic is significant in english because it represents an important aspect of ancient Indian knowledge systems. The study of sentences in the context of english provides valuable insights into how ancient wisdom can inform modern understanding.",
