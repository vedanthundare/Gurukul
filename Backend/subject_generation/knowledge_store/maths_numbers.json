  "translation": "The science of numbers is most beneficial for man, O Suka",
  "explanation": {
    "description": "In ancient Indian mathematics, numbers were not just a tool for calculation but held profound spiritual significance. The concept of 'Astra Vijnanam' or the science of numbers was deeply rooted in the Vedic tradition.",
    "core concepts": "The ancient Indians developed a decimal system based on the concept of zero (Shunya), which revolutionized mathematics and facilitated trade, commerce, and scientific progress. They also made significant contributions to number theory, algebra, and geometry.",
    "connection to Vedic knowledge systems": "The science of numbers was closely tied to the Vedic concept of the universe as an interconnected web of relationships between humans, nature, and the divine. This understanding is reflected in the ancient Indian mathematical texts such as the Baudhayana Sulba Sutra and the Lilavati.",
    "historical context and significance": "The development of ancient Indian mathematics was influenced by various factors, including trade with neighboring countries, the need for astronomical calculations, and the desire to understand the workings of the universe. The contributions of ancient Indians in this field have had a lasting impact on modern mathematics.",
    "relation to modern understanding": "The concept of zero and the decimal system developed by ancient Indians has become an integral part of modern mathematics. Understanding the historical context and significance of these concepts can provide valuable insights into the evolution of mathematics and its applications."

    "title": "Real number",
    "summary": "In mathematics, a real number is a number that can be used to measure a continuous one-dimensional quantity such as a duration or temperature. Here, continuous means that pairs of values can have arbitrarily small differences. Every real number can be almost uniquely represented by an infinite decimal expansion.\nThe real numbers are fundamental in calculus (and in many other branches of mathematics), in particular by their role in the classical definitions of limits, continuity and derivatives.\nThe set of real numbers, sometimes called \"the reals\", is traditionally denoted by a bold R, often using blackboard bold, ⁠\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          R\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} }\n  \n⁠.\nThe adjective real, used in the 17th century by René Descartes, distinguishes real numbers from imaginary numbers such as the square roots of −1.\nThe real numbers include the rational numbers, such as the integer −5 and the fraction 4 / 3. The rest of the real numbers are called irrational numbers. Some irrational numbers (as well as all the rationals) are the root of a polynomial with integer coefficients, such as the square root √2 = 1.414...; these are called algebraic numbers. There are also real numbers which are not, such as π = 3.1415...; these are called transcendental numbers.\n\nReal numbers can be thought of as all points on a line called the number line or real line, where the points corresponding to integers (..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...) are equally spaced.\nThe informal descriptions above of the real numbers are not sufficient for ensuring the correctness of proofs of theorems involving real numbers. The realization that a better definition was needed, and the elaboration of such a definition was a major development of 19th-century mathematics and is the foundation of real analysis, the study of real functions and real-valued sequences. A current axiomatic definition is that real numbers form the unique (up to an isomorphism) Dedekind-complete ordered field. Other common definitions of real numbers include equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences (of rational numbers), Dedekind cuts, and infinite decimal representations. All these definitions satisfy the axiomatic definition and are thus equivalent.",
