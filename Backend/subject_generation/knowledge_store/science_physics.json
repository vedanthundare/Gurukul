  "shloka": "Dhikara Praman Kama Samadhi Parman Vargam",
  "translation": "The science of the self, the soul's state, in the realm of cosmic truth.",
  "explanation": "Physics is rooted in ancient Indian wisdom through concepts like atomism and vedic cosmology. The concept of duality in physics mirrors Yajurvedi's views on reality, while energy conservation teaches us about matter and its transformation. Ancient texts like the *Kamya Samadhi* highlight the self and its role in the universe, influencing modern understanding of quantum mechanics and relativity.",
  "activity": "Students will create a simple atom model using playing cards to visualize subatomic particles and their interactions.",
  "question": "How does our understanding of physics today reflect ancient philosophical concepts about the nature of reality?",

Frick in his publications.\n\n",
