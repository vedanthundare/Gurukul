  "explanation": "According to Wikipedia: Disorders of sex development (DSDs), also known as differences in sex development, variations in sex characteristics (VSC), sexual anomalies, or sexual abnormalities, are congenital conditions affecting the reproductive system, in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical.  \nDSDs are subdivided into groups in which the labels generally emphasize the karyotype's role in diagnosis: 46,XX; 46,XY; sex chromosome; XX, sex reversal; ovotesticular disorder; and XY, sex reversal.\nInfants born with atypical genitalia often cause confusion and distress for the family. Psychosexual development is influenced by numerous factors that include, but are not limited to, gender differences in brain structure, genes associated with sexual development, prenatal androgen exposure, interactions with family, and cultural and societal factors. Because of the complex and multifaceted factors involved, communication and psychosexual support are all important.\nA team of experts, or patient support groups, are usually recommended for cases related to sexual anomalies. This team of experts are usually derived from a variety of disciplines including pediatricians, neonatologists, pediatric urologists, pediatric general surgeons, endocrinologists, geneticists, radiologists, psychologists and social workers. These professionals are capable of providing first line (prenatal) and second line diagnostic (postnatal) tests to examine and diagnose sexual anomalies.\n\n\n\nThis topic is significant in dsds because it represents an important aspect of ancient Indian knowledge systems. The study of dsds in the context of dsds provides valuable insights into how ancient wisdom can inform modern understanding.",
