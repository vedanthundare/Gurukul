  "shloka": "A word is the essence, its primary purpose.",
  "translation": "A word is the core, its main purpose.",
  "explanation": "Words are integral to ancient Indian wisdom as they encapsulate the essence of reality. They can carry different meanings depending on context or the person speaking. This aspect reflects broader philosophical principles such as samhita and samkutna, emphasizing that words reflect deeper truths about the universe and human experience. Ancient texts like the Anaithuramanas highlight words as 'gurana' (good) and 'vibhuti' (goodness), underscoring their importance in holding wisdom.",
  "activity": "Create a word game where students analyze different contexts of the same word to observe its varying meanings. This activity will encourage them to reflect on how context shapes our understanding of words.",
  "question": "In ancient India, is it true that 'words are your guide'? Does one's perception and perspective influence their interpretation of a word?",

    "summary": "English is a West Germanic language that developed in early medieval England and has since become a global lingua franca.  The namesake of the language is the Angles, one of the Germanic peoples that migrated to Britain after its Roman occupiers left. English is the most spoken language in the world, primarily due to the global influences of the former British Empire (succeeded by the Commonwealth of Nations) and the United States. English is the third-most spoken native language after Mandarin Chinese and Spanish; it is also the most widely learned second language in the world, with more second-language speakers than native speakers.\nEnglish is either the official language or one of the official languages in 57 sovereign states and 30 dependent territories, making it the most geographically widespread language in the world. In the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, it is the dominant language for historical reasons without being explicitly defined by law. It is a co-official language of the United Nations, the European Union, and many other international and regional organisations. It has also become the de facto lingua franca of diplomacy, science, technology, international trade, logistics, tourism, aviation, entertainment, and the Internet. English accounts for at least 70% of total native speakers of the Germanic languages, and Ethnologue estimated that there were over 1.4 billion speakers worldwide as of 2021.\nOld English emerged from a group of West Germanic dialects spoken by the Anglo-Saxons. Late Old English borrowed some grammar and core vocabulary from Old Norse, a North Germanic language. Then, Middle English borrowed vocabulary extensively from French dialects, which are the source of approximately 28% of Modern English words, and from Latin, which is the source of an additional 28%. While Latin and the Romance languages are thus the source for a majority of its lexicon taken as a whole, English grammar and phonology retain a family resemblance with the Germanic languages, and most of its basic everyday vocabulary remains Germanic in origin. English exists on a dialect continuum with Scots; it is next-most closely related to Low Saxon and Frisian.",
