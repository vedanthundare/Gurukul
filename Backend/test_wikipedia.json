{"title":"Understanding algebra in maths","level":"intermediate","text":"# SageMath\n\nSageMath (previously Sage or SAGE, \"System for Algebra and Geometry Experimentation\") is a computer algebra system (CAS) with features covering many aspects of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, graph theory, group theory, differentiable manifolds,  numerical analysis, number theory, calculus, and statistics.\nThe first version of SageMath was released on 24 February 2005 as free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2, with the initial goals of creating an \"open source alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica, and MATLAB\". The originator and leader of the SageMath project, William Stein, was a mathematician at the University of Washington.\nSageMath uses a syntax resembling Python's, supporting procedural, functional, and object-oriented constructs.\n\nThis information is sourced from Wikipedia.
