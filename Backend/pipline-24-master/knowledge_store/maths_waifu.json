  "explanation": "In ancient Indian wisdom, mathematics is seen as a tool to understand the universe and our relationships. It's about harmony, balance, and patterns that reflect ethical principles such as dharma and mantras. By studying maths, we uncover how structures in nature, like waifu, represent these conceptsâ€”symmetry, unity, and stability.",
  "activity": "Students will create geometric designs using symbols inspired by waifu, exploring how their shapes (representing numbers) symbolize harmony and balance.",
  "question": "How does maths mirror ancient ethical values, much like how waifu teaches us about relationships and unity?",
